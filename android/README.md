Android covers only subset of Java API which during runtime leads to java.lang.NoSuchMethodError (example is [Files::writeString](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#writeString(java.nio.file.Path,java.lang.CharSequence,java.nio.charset.Charset,java.nio.file.OpenOption...))). This build helps to avoid such exceptions during runtime by making sure that all Java API we use is available in Android during compile time.
